This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### This app is currently deployed on Heroku at the following link:
[React-OpenWeather](https://react-openweather-af84a946646e.herokuapp.com/)

# This app just got new look
Now weather comes with its effect whether

### All effects can be toggled via this panel
So there can be all sunny, rainy, and foggy all at once.

### And full control over all data attributes


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4002](http://localhost:4002) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## API Example
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:4002/api/hello](http://localhost:4002/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
